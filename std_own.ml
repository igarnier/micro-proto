(* 
Idea:
- load code in top level
- the state of the game is persistent data
- which one rewrites by injecting moves
*)

(**
Todo:
- build "tenary" with resampling by game
- finish cl.pay dans ffuse
- add ask field in position
- introduce the ask/take mechanism to resell self-extensions 
(NB: upfront payment become easy if we resell)
- abstraire le code sur les clauses
- provision! lock funds, it is the whole point
- implement multiple tradelines as an array (or a map?)
- implement trapdoor move when > max_delay (already done, anyone can B-move) 
- payments are a functor from the trace = move sequence to tuples of debts
- add a reverse map: Positions -> Players for payments?
 **)

(** 
Optimisations:
- simpler to have owner inside the position?
- to not List.rev all the time keep the list "folded": l <- rev(l1),l2
